# Overtaking Application
## Application Requirements
Python with numpy and pyaudio.
The real version requires the Cohda OBU connected.

## Application Description
In single-lane rural roads, vehicles that want to pass the vehicle in front of them may do so by temporarily driving in the opposite lane. If this maneuver is performed at the wrong time, the vehicle may collide with oncoming vehicles in the opposite lane. This application is designed to be turned on by the driver (or automatically set on), and uses V2V communication to detect both the leading vehicle (that would be overtaken) and oncoming vehicles from the opposite lane.
The simulated version of the app sets up a simple example on a straight road, with oncoming vehicles approaching at random intervals.
