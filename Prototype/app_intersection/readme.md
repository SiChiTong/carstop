# Intersection Collision Warning Application
This application does not actually give warnings in its current state -  
The testing we were able to perform had to follow road rules and therefore would not cause actual warnings.  
The application instead shows the position of all tracked objects near the vehicle, via lidar.

The simulation version uses recorded data from camera and lidar -- not given in this repository.

## Requirements
This demo uses Python with numpy, opencv, and numba.

Required sensors for real version: lidar (either model) and Cohda.
